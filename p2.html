		Q1-- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?
         </ps>
 <br>
<br>
        <p> The system can be developed to various academic theories. It represents the combination of interacting and interdependent activities, parts, organizations, etc., into a whole. The whole will have an impact as the individual changes

             <br>

		Q2-- For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.
             
         </ps>

 <br><br>
<p>
Modularity<br>
By many functional classified individuals together constitute a significant function of a large system.
<br>
             <br>
Decomposibility<br>
The process of breaking down a large individual or aggregate into smaller units or groups from mathematical, chemical, and biological perspectives.
<br>
             <br>
Emergence<br>
emergence occurs when a system features an individual with attributes, functions, and behaviors that he or she does not have. This is a description of the phenomenon of the production of fresh elements.
<br><br>
Chaos Theory<br>
In the huge group or phenomenon formed by countless small individuals, the small deviation of the individual leads to great changes and chaos of the whole group.

         The system can be developed to various academic theories. It represents the combination of interacting and interdependent activities, parts, organizations, etc., into a whole. The whole will have an impact as the individual changes

		Q3-- What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?
         </ps>

 <br>
<br>
         <p>
         Tesselation is a group of individuals with the same geometric shape arranged repeatedly and formed with visual effects.
Modularity is a systematic classification procedure that classifies a large group from functions and categories to different individ

		Q4-- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)
         </ps>


 <br>
<br>
         <p>
         Complexity refers to systems that have a large number of interacting parts, often with unpredictable and non-repeating patterns of behavior. On the other hand, uniformity (periodicity) refers to systems that have a consistent and repeating pattern of behavior. Designing for uniformity often involves finding simple, repeating patterns that can be easily applied to a system

		Q5-- What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug. Please explain in complete sentances.

         </ps>



 <br>
<br>
         <p>
         The System diagram is the explanation of the decomposition of the group structure of each functional organization in the system and the principle of the interaction between groups. The exploded view drawing is the decomposition and rendering of each component of a complex object, which is a more concrete existence than system diagram.

This graph shows factors that may affect the trend and direction of a tree's branches. The dispersal and growth direction of branches are generally regular and even fixed. However, the appearance of a stone is likely to affect the direction of the branches and change a fixed law.</ps>
